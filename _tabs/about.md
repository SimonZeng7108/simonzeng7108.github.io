This paper presents a deep learning framework for medical video segmentation. Convolution neural network (CNN) and transformer-based methods have achieved great milestones in medical image segmentation tasks due to their incredible semantic feature encoding and global information comprehension abilities. However, most existing approaches ignore a salient aspect of medical video data - the temporal dimension. Our proposed framework explicitly extracts features from neighbouring frames across the temporal dimension and incorporates them with a novel temporal feature blender which then tokenises the high-level Spatio-temporal feature to a strong global feature encoder Swin Transformer. The final segmentation results are produced via a UNet-like encoder-decoder architecture. Our model outperforms other approaches by a significant margin and improves the segmentation benchmarks on the VFSS2022 dataset, achieving a dice coefficient of 0.8986/0.8186 for Part1/Part2 data. Our studies have also shown the efficacy of the temporal feature blending scheme and the transferability of the framework.

Chengxi Zeng, Arion.ai, CGG <br/>
We developed a deep learning pipeline that processes long lithology tracks to multi-page images, a fast bounding box detection algorithm is employed and calibrated. Segmentation models are used to extract the curves and hence the numerical data is restored. The pipeline is tested on 1000+ documents and the results are promising.

We propose Video-TransUNet, a deep architecture for instance segmentation in medical CT videos constructed by integrating temporal feature blending into the TransUNet deep learning framework. In particular, our approach amalgamates strong frame representation via a ResNet CNN backbone, multi-frame feature blending via a Temporal Context Module (TCM), non-local attention via a Vision Transformer, and reconstructive capabilities for multiple targets via a UNet-based convolutional-deconvolutional architecture with multiple heads.
