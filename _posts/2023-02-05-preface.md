## Harbour side walk
Today, half way finishing this first ever post in my blog, we went for a harbour side walk with our new friend Gabriele, a visiting PhD student from Italy. The [**harbour side walk**](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=13ZctgIiO9eEENNbgO2KNxucnDWpySU0&usp=sharing) seems to become a pilgrimage for new comers to Bristol, except we don't worship along the way. It usually starts from our office and comes back ending in a pub. The weather is beautifully rare in February time in the UK. We had fun.

## Purpose of this blog
This blog is not a place for me to write long and stinky diaries. I want to make it as an organised and clean space to store my knowledge along my PhD. I want to share this scientific knowledge with concise English and a bit of computer code to you. It is also the best way to test and practice what I have learnt. Let's finish this post with a Feynman's quote:
> “What I Cannot Create, I Do Not Understand.”
